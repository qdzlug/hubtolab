# GitHub to GitLab Repository Mirroring

This repository contains scripts to automate the process of mirroring repositories from GitHub to GitLab. It includes everything needed to set up new repositories on GitLab (if they do not already exist) and to keep them synchronized with their counterparts on GitHub.

## Features

- **Repository Creation**: Automates the creation of new GitLab projects via API.
- **Repository Mirroring**: Sets up and maintains mirrors from GitHub to GitLab.
- **Update Synchronization**: Regularly updates GitLab mirrors to reflect changes made in GitHub repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Administrative access to both GitHub and GitLab accounts.
- Personal Access Tokens from GitHub with `repo` scope and from GitLab with `api` scope.
- Python3 and Bash environment for executing scripts.

## Setup

1. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-directory
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file based on the `env.example` provided in this repository, and update it with your specific credentials:
   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_USER=your_github_username
   GITLAB_INSTANCE=your_gitlab_instance_url
   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_gitlab_access_token
   NAMESPACE_ID=optional_gitlab_namespace_id
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Creating GitLab Projects

Run the `gl_repo_create.py` script to create a new project in GitLab:

```bash
python gl_repo_create.py "NewProjectName"
```

### Setting Up Repository Mirroring

To set up mirroring for specific repositories:

```bash
./setup_mirror.sh repo1 repo2 repo3
```

### Updating Repository Mirrors

Schedule the `update_mirror.sh` script using cron jobs or manually run it to synchronize changes:

```bash
./update_mirror.sh repo1 repo2 repo3
```

## Scheduling Automatic Updates

Add a cron job to run the update script at regular intervals:

```cron
0 * * * * /path/to/update_mirror.sh repo1 repo2 repo3
```
